For app.py, copy and paste into library to install necessary libraries:
pip install flask, flask_cors, langchain_ollama, langchain.prompts, sentence_transformers, torch

Instructions for frontend changes (if any updates are made to index.html or anything in the src folder, please update build):
cd frontend
npm run build //this will create/update a 'build' folder that runs the REACT .js and .css files in the src folder

There is a node-modules folder in the frontend folder, I believe this is created when making the react app. Use this terminal command to create the react app if the node-modules folder causes errors when unzipped or if unzipping takes too long:
npx create-react-app frontend

To run the fully connected app:
1. make the build folder if any changes are made
2. follow the next steps in command terminal

cd backend
python app.py
