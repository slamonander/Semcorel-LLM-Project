BLE 5.2 can theoretically support a range of up to 240 meters (800 feet) under ideal conditions with no obstructions, while the typical range for Bluetooth 3.0 devices is around 10 meters (33 feet). However, typical indoor environments may significantly reduce these ranges.\n\n In our tests, ensuring that your smartphone remains within a 30-foot range of your CoCo smartwatch will help maintain stable connectivity. This takes into account surrounding materials, as Bluetooth signals are limited in reach and can be disrupted by obstacles like walls or electronic interference. The CoCo BT2 smartwatch can store up to 7 days of health and activity data on the watch if it has been disconnected from its paired smartphone. The CoCo App will automatically reconnect the CoCo smartwatch if it comes back into range.\"",
