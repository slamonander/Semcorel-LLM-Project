However, typical indoor environments may significantly reduce these ranges.

 In our tests, ensuring that your smartphone remains within a 30-foot range of your CoCo smartwatch will help maintain stable connectivity.

Additionally, please ensure the CoCo app has sufficient permissions to run in the background when your smartphone screen is off; it consumes negligible resources. Sometimes, restarting your smartphone and reopening the CoCo App can fix this issue.

If you swipe the watch face toward you, you can see the connection status, which looks like a chain link. If connected, it shows a green line in the middle of that chain link.
