# Installing unsloth:
https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation-instructions

    #I had problems installing this, you may have to install PyTorch and Triton to install unsloth


# Once those two libraries are installed run the following commands in terminal:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"


#For prompting we must follow the huggingface prompt template, which will be added to the prompt spreadsheet in google drive
    #Or huggingface does it automatically?
        pip install datasets
