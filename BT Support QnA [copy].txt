Fall detection activation
Thank you for reaching out. We understand that fall detection is very important.

When the system detects a fall, it will start a 20-second countdown. If the countdown is not canceled before it reaches 0, it will send an SMS and initiate a video call (through a push notification, so notification permissions must be granted to the CoCo app on the ECT contact's device). 

Additionally, fall detection is disabled by default. You need to manually enable it using the following steps to activate it:
1. Ensure that your CoCo watch is paired with your smartphone and connected.
2. Log in to the CoCo app on your smartphone.
3. Navigate to "Settings."
4. Click on "Fall Detection" to go to its configuration page.
5. Activate it.
This will push the configuration to your smartwatch.
Please be aware that currently, fall detection only works for serious falls to avoid false alarms. We are going to add options to adjust the sensitivity settings in the future.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.


ECT Initiation
CoCo would like to leverage the assistance from family and friends to provide help. We recommend you use the Emergency Care Team (ECT) first. The process for ECT is:
ECT Call Initiation:
   - **Manual**: The customer can initiate an ECT call by pressing the ECT Call button on the watch face for 3 seconds, pressing the ECT button on the side of the smartwatch for 3 seconds, or via the CoCo app in the emergency tab.
   - **Automatic**: CoCo can automatically initiate an ECT call when it detects an emergency, such as a fall (if the call is not canceled after a 20-second countdown), a health emergency (for premium customers only), or being out of the safe zone for too long (for premium customers only).
The direct 911 button on the CoCo app is a quick call button. When you click 911, it places 911 on your phone's dialer, so you don't need to dial the number manually. You only need to press "call" to make the emergency call.

BT2 does not get weather information
Thanks for reaching out to us. We understand the importance of receiving accurate weather information.


The CoCo smartwatch utilizes the location of its paired smartphone to update its weather information. Please grant the CoCo App permission to access your phone's location and reconnect with your CoCo smartwatch if you would like to receive the updated weather immediately. Alternatively, you can wait for the CoCo app to sync automatically. CoCo updates its weather information every hour automatically.
BT2 Cannot receive phone calls
If you're not receiving calls normally, it likely means the CoCo watch doesn't have the necessary permissions. Please check two settings on your phone:
* 1. Go to 'Settings' -> 'Bluetooth', tap your CoCo watch's name, and ensure the following permissions are granted. If you want the CoCo watch to display your contact's name, please also enable 'Contacts' as shown in the following screenshot (note that your CoCo watch may have a different ID):

BT2 contacts limitation
Thank you for reaching out. We understand that having all contact information accessible on the watch is convenient. However, due to storage limitations, the BT2 can currently save a maximum of 75 contacts. We will try to increase this capacity in our future models.


Please let us know if you have any more questions.


Disconnected warning
Thank you for reaching out to us. It is crucial for the CoCo smartwatch to maintain a stable connection with the outside world. Based on your description, it seems that the smartwatch connects to your phone but experiences intermittent disconnections, displaying a 'disconnecting' warning each time it transitions to a disconnected state until the next reconnection. To address this, ensure your smartphone remains within a 33 ft range of your CoCo smartwatch, taking into account surrounding materials, as Bluetooth signals have limited reach and obstacles like walls or electronic interference can disrupt the connection. Additionally, please make sure to have the latest CoCo application installed and attempt to reconnect to check if the stability improves. If the issue persists, please feel free to reach out for further assistance.


BT2 Bluetooth 


BT2 is equipped with two Bluetooth chips: one supporting data transfer via BLE 5.2 and the other supporting audio transfer via BLE 3.0. BLE 5.2 can theoretically support a range of up to 240 meters (800 feet) under ideal conditions with no obstructions, while the typical range for Bluetooth 3.0 devices is around 10 meters (33 feet). However, typical indoor environments may significantly reduce these ranges.


 In our tests, ensuring that your smartphone remains within a 30-foot range of your CoCo smartwatch will help maintain stable connectivity. This takes into account surrounding materials, as Bluetooth signals are limited in reach and can be disrupted by obstacles like walls or electronic interference. The CoCo BT2 smartwatch can store up to 7 days of health and activity data on the watch if it has been disconnected from its paired smartphone. The CoCo App will automatically reconnect the CoCo smartwatch if it comes back into range.


BT2 does not stay connected (to user)


Thank you for reaching out to us. It is crucial for the CoCo smartwatch to maintain a stable connection with the outside world.
For staying connected, we normally recommend keeping the smartphone within a 33 ft range of the CoCo smartwatch indoors to ensure a stable connection, considering the surrounding materials. Bluetooth signals have limited reach, and obstacles like walls or electronic interference can disrupt the connection. However, if the watch disconnects from the phone, it will automatically reconnect when it comes back within range.


Additionally, please ensure the CoCo app has sufficient permissions to run in the background when your smartphone screen is off; it consumes negligible resources. Sometimes, restarting your smartphone and reopening the CoCo App can fix this issue.


The watch itself can store 7 days of health and activity data, meaning if there is no connection for 7 days, there will be no data loss, but you cannot view the health data remotely.




Disconnect from its paired smartphone (to contact)
Thank you for contacting us. Normally, to ensure a stable connection, we recommend keeping the smartphone within a 33 ft range of the CoCo smartwatch indoors, considering the surrounding materials. Bluetooth signals have limited reach, and obstacles like walls or electronic interference can disrupt the connection. However, if the watch disconnects from the phone, it will automatically reconnect when it comes back within range.


From what you described, since it has been next to its paired phone, please check whether the CoCo app has been closed by the iOS system. Additionally, please ensure the CoCo app has sufficient permissions to run in the background when your smartphone screen is off; it consumes resources that are negligible.


The watch itself can store 7 days of health and activity data, meaning if there is no connection for 7 days, there will be no data loss, but you cannot view the health data remotely.


Data is not in sync between the watch and app
Thanks for contacting us. We understand that having the same data on the watch and the app is important. The data on the watch and the app syncs every 10 minutes. If you don't see them in sync after 10 minutes, could you please check if the watch is connected to its paired phone? If you swipe the watch face toward you, you can see the connection status, which looks like a chain link. If connected, it shows a green line in the middle of that chain link. You can also see the connection status in the app.


If they are not connected, to ensure a stable connection, we recommend keeping the smartphone within a 33 ft range of the CoCo smartwatch indoors, considering the surrounding materials. Bluetooth signals have limited reach, and obstacles like walls or electronic interference can disrupt the connection. However, if the watch disconnects from the phone, it will automatically reconnect when it comes back within range.


If they are within range and still not connected, please check whether the CoCo app has been closed by the phone’s OS system. Additionally, please ensure the CoCo app has sufficient permissions to run in the background when your smartphone screen is off; it consumes negligible resources.


The watch itself can store 7 days of health and activity data, meaning if there is no connection for 7 days, there will be no data loss, but you cannot view the health data remotely.




Turn on Notifications for CoCo App in Android Phone

Test ECT permission
Only the CoCo watch user needs to have a subscription. In fact, if you only need two contacts, you don't need any subscription: it's completely free. However, we recommend a subscription to enjoy all other benefits.
To check and test (for identifying issues) all the permissions, please try the following steps:
For the contacts:
* 1. Open the CoCo App.
* 2. Log in with their own credentials: CoCo ID and password.
* 3. Keep the CoCo app open on its screen and wait there.
For the CoCo watch user:
* 1. Open the CoCo app.
* 2. Log in with your own credentials: CoCo ID and password.
* 3. Go to the "Emergency" tab.

BT2-Z no Call ECT watch face
Thank you for reaching out. We understand that accessing the ECT button is crucial in case of an emergency, and the CoCo smartwatch is designed for this purpose.

3. Battery Levels: Both devices should have adequate battery power. Low battery levels might prevent certain functions.


4. Volume and Sound Settings: Check the sound settings on both your watch and phone. Ensure that the volume is up and that the sound is not directed to an unintended output.


If none of these steps resolve the issue, please let us know.
Update failed because of disruption in the middle
Thank you for contacting us! We understand that the update was disrupted while it was in the process of updating. Please try reconnecting it with your smartphone to bring it back. We understand that the watch face might be black, but don't worry about it as long as you are sure that it is charged.

3. Option 2: Keep swiping towards your arm, 8 times.


Please let me know if you have any questions.


Video call issues;
Thank you for contacting us! We are very sorry for the inconvenience regarding the video call issue. Let us clarify a bit: are you referring to a regular video call, meaning clicking the video button directly to start the video, or is it a part of the ECT process that you're unable to access the video call?
Regular video calls are only available for premium users. However, video calls for ECT are available to everyone. Please ensure that you have granted the CoCo app video call permissions, which are normally requested when you use it for the first time. You might have accidentally declined them. To check and test this, please ask Elizabeth to initiate an ECT call from her CoCo app:
* Go to 'Emergency'.
* Click 'Care Team'.
If it requires specific permissions, it will prompt you. Grant all the requested permissions and then try again, either from the CoCo watch or from your phone. Please let us know if you have any questions.
Questions related to Subscription / Premium
Thanks for contacting us. All the watch features, such as fall detection, health data monitoring, etc., are free. Most of the CoCo services are free as well. However, there are advantages to becoming a CoCo premium member, such as a lifetime warranty for CoCo devices, unlimited emergency contacts (the free version provides up to 2 emergency contacts), faster technical support (including phone support), etc. It also provides a 30-day free trial and can be canceled any time before that 30 days without any charges.


Please let us know if you have more questions or concerns.


No health data for Contact
Thank you for contacting us. We understand the importance of remotely monitoring the health of your loved one.
Could you please check the following two items?
1. Confirm if they have been consistently wearing the smartwatch.
2. If yes, please ensure that the smartwatch is within a range of approximately 30 feet. Although it’s not necessary for the smartwatch to be constantly within this range, as the CoCo smartwatch can store up to 7 days of health data, it does need to be within this range periodically. This allows the smartwatch to automatically reconnect with its paired smartphone and send the stored data for your remote viewing. For instance, if they are out of range for a few hours, the smartwatch should automatically reconnect and transmit data once they are back within range.
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.








BT1 does not work
Sorry for this inconvenience. But don't worry, CoCo will fix this for you.

Another thing related to this is the sound setting on your watch. Please refer to the following videos for details:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsQW1Ssf1cU


Change CoCo smartwatch language<Grammar checked>
Thank you for choosing CoCo! We recognize the importance of having the correct language.
CoCo automatically syncs its language and time with the connected smartphone, regardless of the default language. The CoCo Smartwatch BT2 and BT2-Z support 18 different languages. Please ensure that the smartphone connected to the CoCo watch has your preferred language and time settings. If it does, try reconnecting the CoCo watch to see if it resolves the issue.

Thank you for choosing CoCo! We understand the importance of switching the CoCo watch to Daylight Saving Time. 


CoCo automatically syncs its time and language with the connected smartphone. Please ensure that the smartphone connected to the CoCo watch is set to Daylight Saving Time.

Feel free to let us know if you have any more questions.


https://youtu.be/Y6ZlCAyPRaI
Please let us know if you have any more questions.




How to wear it correctly?
  

1. How does ECT work? 
To make ECT work, please add each other as your contact and ask them to accept your invitation in CoCo App, please follow steps in the following video:
https://youtu.be/-rYtSQM6pYs


If you have your husband as your ECT contact, please make sure your husband accepts your invitation inside the CoCo App after you send them the invitation.


Before is the video how ECT should work after he accepted:
https://youtu.be/uvnyJ0GO0A0
(Please let us know if it does not work in that way)


2. Set up Call 911 directly
Thanks for contacting us. We understand that being able to call 911 quickly is crucial in an emergency.


To call 911, you can use the dial pad on your smartwatch and dial 911.


Please note that currently, the CoCo watch does not automatically call 911. CoCo handles emergencies by maximizing support from the family, friends, and caregivers. When the system detects an emergency, it initiates an ECT (Emergency Care Team) call. This sends both a text message and a video call, broadcasting your live location and vital data to all your ECT contacts. They can help you call 911.


Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.


 Call 911


Currently, we don't send 911 automatically, after your caregiver clicks call 911, we put the 911 call in its phone pad, they need to do another click to send the call out. The reason to add an extra step is to prevent miss clicks.


3. How ECT work?
When you hold the red rectangular ECT button on your watch face or the physical ECT button on the side of your smartwatch, your watch will start a 20-second countdown. You can click "Call Now" to immediately send out the ECT call. This will trigger both a text message and a video call to your preconfigured "Emergency Contact." Please refer to the following video to see how it works:


https://youtu.be/uvnyJ0GO0A0


You don’t need to be as close to your smartphone as in the video; it was made for demo purposes using one camera without any editing.


If it doesn’t work as described, please let us know.


2. ECT call cannot talk through the watch
Thank you for contacting us. We understand that the correct functioning of ECT is crucial. When you make a call from the watch, either by long pressing the "Call ECT" button or holding down the long button on the side of the watch, here is what is expected:


1. SMS messages and a video conference call will be sent to all the contacts' smartphones through the CoCo App. The contacts need to "Accept" the call to join the video conference.
2. From the watch user's side, it will display who is in the call and their distance from the user; at the same time, it will continuously take vital data and location information to broadcast to all contacts in that conference.
3. The watch user cannot speak through the watch (we plan to improve this feature in the future).


Here's a video on how it works:
Link to the video 
or copy and paste the following link to your browser directly.

3. Change ECT person

1. Click "Settings" at the right bottom of CoCo App
2. Click "Contacts" button the right side button in the middle

4. Click "Delete" for those contacts you want to change
5. After that, add the contact you'd like to add.




Thank you for giving CoCo the opportunity to serve you! Unfortunately, the service and products did not satisfy your expectations. We are very sorry for all those troubles you have experienced.


To erase the data from the watch, please go to "Setting" and then click "Reset" on your watch, the watch will go to manufacturer mode.
